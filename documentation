I know I should have used swagger but I'm lazy right now. 
I also know I should have made it use post put delete patch, and whatever but honest I'm too paranoid for a post request let alone
the others lot's of neat vectors for xml based attack don't tell me nokogiri patched its xxe vuln parsers are extremely 
vulnerable by default.

The supported groups are: 
  FreeSyrianArmy         
  alnusra                
  hezbollah     
  syriandemocraticforces
  
in order to retrieve news about a specific group it goes 

http://54.163.183.214/groups/news/:groupname 
so to find news from hezbollah you would go
  http://54.163.183.214/groups/news/hezbollah 

Parsing 
  It's in xml but when they get large it gets unwieldly so use an html parser instead.I sort of regret using Nokogiris XML builder
  in a block 
  the parent element is body  the elements to parse remain the same through out all of the resources so it's going to be 
  tit for the articles title date for the articles date body for the articles date. 
  so an example of how to parse code wise would be: 
  parser = Nokogiri::HTML(doc)
  bod = parser.xpath("//body")
  bod.each do |x|
    title = x.xpath("//tit").text
    article = x.xpath(//).text
    date = x.xpath(//date).text
    out = "#{title} \n #{date} \n \n" #{article} \n\n"
  end
